We provide educational programs, research based consulting services, and program observations/evaluations to help organizations who work with early learners and their families improve their practice. We help organizations make data-based decisions about program improvements and/or offer programs in areas like early computer concepts, literacy and storytelling. We work with informal (e.g., museums, zoos, parks) and formal (e.g., schools) learning environments. And, we are passionate about helping to reduce the achievement gap.</h2>

<p>On a policy level our approach assumes that if educators are doing there jobs, all children will engage in the types of normative developmental milestones that comprise childhood learning. </p>

<p>We believe that computer programming is an aspect of early literacy. We offer programs to introduce early computer concepts to children and their families. Parents leave with a sense that their child is smarter than they they thought. And, importantly with a set of fun activities to use in their homes. </p>
