We provide educational programs, research based consulting services, and program observations/evaluations to help organizations who work with early learners and their families improve their practice. We help organizations make data-based decisions about program improvements and/or offer programs in areas like early computer concepts, literacy and storytelling. We work with informal (e.g., museums, zoos, parks) and formal (e.g., schools) learning environments. And, we are passionate about helping to reduce the achievement gap. \r\n\r\n##Our metrics focus on the human experience in terms of 5 domains of child development: \r\n\r\nLanguage, Literacy & Communication; \r\n\r\nCognition & General Knowledge; \r\n\r\nSocial & Emotional Development; \r\n\r\nApproaches Towards Learning; \r\n\r\nPhysical, Health & Well-Being (see Feldman, 2011).\r\n\r\n###We protect the privacy of individual children by focusing on group behavior and the behavioral milestones evidenced in groups of children as they play with their caregivers and/or materials. \r\n\r\nOn a policy level our approach assumes that if educators are doing there jobs, all children will engage in the types of normative developmental milestones that comprise childhood learning. \r\n\r\n#Our programs offer supportive ways to engage young children in competencies that they will soon master on their own. \r\n\r\n![10384816_803457493033772_6486107949983618459_n](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10938387/10342902/28b3d372-6cd0-11e5-8abb-047bef7e9e51.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe believe that computer programming is an aspect of early literacy. We offer programs to introduce early computer concepts to children and their families. Parents leave with a sense that their child is smarter than they they thought. And, importantly with a set of fun activities to use in their homes. \r\n\r\n![10861130_817089048337283_8960337171813076273_o 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10938387/10342995/9fcf2a88-6cd0-11e5-9cf3-78743797c992.jpg)\r\n\r\n##Emerging Work with School-age Children\r\n\r\nWe have recently begun working with organizations serving school-aged children. More specifically, we've been integrating the Common Core (CC) and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) into our metrics.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to know more about our organization or would like to schedule a consultation, please send an email to our Director: Erika N.
